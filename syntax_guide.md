# Data Load editor syntax cheat sheet

These are my own Notes for the purpose of refernce, and to hopefully create a streamlined way of getting to know the syntax of this program. Note that it accepts SQL, and possibly other programming languages, but with a twist. 


- Single quotes 'b' are literal meaning it will only return things that exactly match b
  - i.e: sum({$<categoryname={'Bath Clothes'}>})

- Double quotes "b" for a search of b
sum({$<categoryname={"Clothes"}>})
